<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>Splicing binding constructs for syntactic keywords are versions
  of <code>let-syntax</code> and <code>letrec-syntax</code> that can
  be used in a definition context in the same way
  as <code>begin</code>.
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>The R7RS defines two binding constructs for syntactic keywords,
  namely <code>let-syntax</code> and <code>letrec-syntax</code>.  Both
  are equivalent to their R5RS versions and are expressions.</p>

<p>The R6RS versions of <code>let-syntax</code>
  and <code>letrec-syntax</code> are equivalent to the R5RS/R7RS
  version when they are not in a definition context.  In a definition
  context, however, the R6RS versions splice their body forms in the
  enclosing definition context.
</p>

<p>In some sense, the R6RS splicing versions are more fundamental than the
  R5RS/R7RS non-splicing versions as one can easily define the
  non-splicing versions by way of a <code>syntax-rules</code> macro in
  terms of the splicing versions.  Moreover, the non-splicing versions
  can also be defined by way of a <code>syntax-rules</code> macro in
  terms of the local <code>define-syntax</code>.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, the splicing versions cannot be defined through
  the non-splicing versions or <code>define-syntax</code>.
</p>

<p>The usefulness of the splicing versions seems to be
  non-controversial.  For
  example, <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-148/srfi-148.html#em">SRFI
  148's <code>em</code> syntax</a> would become unnecessary.
</p>

<p>Thus, this SRFI proposes splicing versions
  of <code>let-syntax</code> and <code>letrec-syntax</code> for R7RS
  under a different name.  Note, however, that, in some corner cases,
  the splicing versions cannot be a drop-in replacement for the
  non-splicing forms (only that the non-splicing forms can be defined
  as derived syntax in terms of the splicing forms).
</p>

<h1>Examples</h1>

<p>The following examples show the difference between the non-splicing
and splicing behavior.</p>

<p>This expression evaluates to <code>let-syntax</code>:</p>

<pre>
(let ((x 'let-syntax))
  (let-syntax ()
    (define x 'splicing-let-syntax)
    #f)
  x)
</pre>

<p>This expression evaluates to <code>splicing-let-syntax</code>:</p>

<pre>
(let ((x 'let-syntax))
  (splicing-let-syntax ()
    (define x 'splicing-let-syntax)
    #f)
  x)
</pre>

<p>For more examples, see the test suite that comes bundled with this
specification.</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><code>(splicing-let-syntax ((〈keyword〉 〈transformer spec〉) ...)
〈form〉 ...)</code></p>

<p>Like <code>(let-syntax ((〈keyword〉 〈transformer spec〉) ...)
    〈form〉 ...)</code> except that in a definition context, the forms
  <code>〈form〉 ...</code> are spliced into the enclosing definition context (in the
  same way as for <code>begin</code>).
</p>

<p>Note: The R6RS version is a bit more restricted.  There, in a definition context,
  the forms <code>〈form〉 ...</code> all have to be definitions and, in an expression
  context, the forms <code>〈form〉 ...</code> all have to expressions.
</p>

<p><code>(splicing-letrec-syntax ((〈keyword〉 〈transformer spec〉) ...)
〈form〉 ...)</code></p>

<p>Like <code>(letrec-syntax ((〈keyword〉 〈transformer spec〉) ...)
    〈form〉 ...)</code> except that in a definition context, the forms
  <code>〈form〉 ...</code> are spliced into the enclosing definition context (in the
  same way as for <code>begin</code>).
</p>

<p>Note: The R6RS version is a bit more restricted.  There, in a definition context,
  the forms <code>〈form〉 ...</code> all have to be definitions and, in an expression
  context, the forms <code>〈form〉 ...</code> all have to expressions.
</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>A portable R7RS implementation of the binding constructs described
  here is not possible.
</p>

<p>The splicing binding constructs as described here are at least provided by
  Chibi Scheme, Chez Scheme, and Racket.
</p>

<p>A Chibi Scheme implementation (<code><a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-188/srfi-188.tgz">.tgz</a></code>, <a href="https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-188">Github</a>)
  together with a SRFI 64 test suite is bundled with this
  specification.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>The constructs described here aren't new but go back to the
R4RS/R5RS (in the non-splicing version) and the R6RS (in the splicing
version).  Thanks go to the editors of the (revised) reports on the
algorithmic language Scheme.
